### üìä Understanding our Feature Importance Graph:

- **Why is `SHOT_DIST` the most dominant feature?**  
  In basketball, shot distance plays a **key role** in determining shot success. Closer shots are **more likely to go in** compared to mid-range or long-range shots.  
   
- **What about `CLOSE_DEF_DIST`?**  
  The distance of the defender plays another significant role in shot success. If a defender is **far away**, the player has **more space and time to take a good shot**.

- **Does the model only rely on distance?**  
  No! Other factors like **shot difficulty, shot clock, and player attributes** still contribute to the overall prediction.

üí° **Takeaway:** This model reflects how **basketball shots** are affected based on various features such as shot distance and defender proximity while still considering in-game context.
